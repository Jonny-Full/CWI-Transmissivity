  abstract = {Abstract. Specific capacity data obtained from well construction reports can provide useful estimates of hydraulic conductivity (K). A simple computer program has been developed which can correct specific capacity data for partial penetration and well loss and, using an iterative technique, provide rapid estimates of K at hundreds of data points. The program allows easy data handling and is easily linked with existing statistical programs or contour mapping routines. The method was tested at two field sites in Wisconsin, one underlain by a sandy outwash aquifer, the other by fractured dolomite. In both areas, estimates of K from corrected specific capacity data agree reasonably well with data from pumping tests.},

  abstract = {When a well is pumped or otherwise discharged, water-levels in its neighborhood are lowered. Unless this lowering occurs instantaneously it represents a loss of storage, either by the un-watering of a portion of the previously saturated sediments if the aquifer is nonartesian or by release of stored water by the compaction of the aquifer due to the lowered pressure if the aquifer is artesian. The mathematical theory of ground-water hydraulics has been based, apparently entirely, on a postulate that equilibrium has been attained and therefore that water-levels are no longer falling. In a great number of hydrologic problems, involving a well or pumping district near or in which water-levels are falling, the current theory is therefore not strictly applicable. This paper investigates in part the nature and consequences of a mathematical theory that considers the motion of ground-water before equilibrium is reached and, as a consequence, involves time as a variable.},
